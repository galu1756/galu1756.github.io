    These are just some of my family members, I have a lot more cousins and they are all in Romania. One of my moms
    sister now lives in Germany. She is my God-Fathers wife. They have two girls, their names are Bettina and Beatris.
    My mom has two more brothers and another sister in Romania. I have the rest of my cousins living in Romania. The way
    Romania is, is that we can walk to each other and you usually don't have a car. So, long distances are usually travelled by a
    horse and carriage. If the distance is even longer you usually get your own car, or borrow someones if you can't
    afford one. The city is not that far from where I lived, because we lived in a small village called Cenad and the
    closest city was Sannicolaul Mare. (It is about 5 miles) If you go into both the city, and then come to the village it's a major difference in
    lifestyle. The village is more farmland and everyone usually gets most of their food from their own livestock.
