            I chose this class because it really interests me and I do have a nac for it. I know how to use the computer
            fairly well, but I would like to extend my knowledge on a more detailed explanation on how everything works.
            If there is a problem with my computer I want to be able to know what's going on to know what I might need to do to fix it

            This is a class where you get ("Free Will" - Mr. K 2k18) and you get to choose exactly how you want something,
            you also struggle just enough to make it not easy of a class. You need to do some research on your own to
            figure out out how to code something. If you can't you go and team up with someone to help you out with the coding

            I am enjoying this class pretty well so far. It has it's ups and downs. What I mean by that is that it has
            it's very interesting parts, for example this project. Other than that the class is really enjoyable I come
            to the computer lab whenever I get the chance because I can never get enough of the coding aspect of the page
