<p>
    I am a Freshman at Hoffman Estates High School and so far am enjoying my stay.<br>
    So far all the classes I have are pretty enjoyable especially Computer Science.<br>
    I like playing guitar outside of school and I even have my own band named M.O.R.E<br>
    That stands for Matthew, Omar, Rogelio, and me Erik.<br>
    We are playing in the V-show so come and watch us perform.<br>
    This table shows my daily A and B days at HEHS.
